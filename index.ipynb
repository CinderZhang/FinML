They cover banking, business/fiscal, consumer price indexes, employment and population, exchange rates, gross domestic product, interest rates, monetary aggregates, producer price indexes, reserves and monetary base, U.S. trade and international transactions, and U.S. financial data. The time series are compiled by the Federal Reserve and many are collected from government agencies such as the U.S. Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The economic data published on FRED are widely reported in the media and play a key role in financial markets. In a 2012 Business Insider article titled \"The Most Amazing Economics Website in the World\", Joe Weisenthal quoted Paul Krugman as saying: \"I think just about everyone doing short-order research — trying to make sense of economic issues in more or less real time — has become a FRED fanatic.\"[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Economic_Data#cite_note-2)\n",
